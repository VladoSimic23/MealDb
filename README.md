## REACT - Create React App
Create React App (CRA) is a tool developed by Facebook that helps you quickly set up a new React project with no configuration needed. It includes a pre-configured build process, development server, and a set of pre-installed dependencies that allow you to start building a new React application immediately. CRA abstracts away the complexity of configuring a new React project, and provides a standardized starting point that can be customized to fit your needs.

## Typescript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to improve the development experience, catch errors earlier, and make code more scalable and maintainable. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, allowing developers to use it in any environment that supports JavaScript
